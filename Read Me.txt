The scripts provided in this directory are those used to process the data
set considered in the research. All data used in the paper (processed) may
be accessed in the "data" folder. Data which contains unprocessed data 
were omitted due to patenting concerns. However, a pseudo-data set is
presented for the purpose of illustrating how data should be encoded (on
an Excel file), and to show how the scripts would work. Since by running 
the scrips, the original (presented) files may be overriden, a copy
folder "cpy_data" is made available to restore and use/plot/analyze the
paper's data when needed. 

Note: The pseudo-data comprises of 88 malignant and 78 benign ftir spectral
vectors (same as that of the paper) but of which absorbance values ARE NOT
those used (again due to patenting concerns) but rather generated for 
illustration purposes. The spectral data were randomly generated using the
eigenvectors for each benign and malignant data set which sums up >99%
of variability. Here, the mean and standard deviation of the projection of
the malignant and benign data set to each eigenvector was obtained. A 
random value using the obtained means and standard deviations were 
generated using a gaussian random generator. The random values generated
were then used to "recreate" a benign or malignant spectrum. The 
eigenvector profiles for benign and malignant data are stored in the MATLAB
files "ben_eigenvectors.mat" and "mal_eigenvectors.mat" respectively under
the "data/set generator/" folder. One may also generate a new pseudodata 
set using the script "GeneratePseudodata.m".
